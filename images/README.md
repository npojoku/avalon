# Product images from Amazon

To use the **actual Avalon product photos** on the site:

1. Open the product page:  
   **https://www.amazon.com/Avalon-24-Piece-Silverware-Stainless-Flatware/dp/B07F1X617C**

2. In the image gallery (main image + thumbnails), **right‑click** each image and choose **“Save image as…”** (or “Save picture as…”).

3. Save them into this `images` folder with these exact names:

   | File name     | Use for                         | Suggested source on Amazon      |
   |---------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
   | `hero.jpg`    | Full-width hero at the top      | Main product image               |
   | `gallery1.jpg`| First gallery tile              | Any product or flatware shot     |
   | `gallery2.jpg`| Second gallery tile             | Another angle or the open box    |
   | `gallery3.jpg`| Third gallery tile              | Close-up or place setting        |
   | `gallery4.jpg`| Wide gallery strip              | Full set or table setting        |
   | `gallery5.jpg`| Fifth gallery tile              | Detail (e.g. fork/spoon/knife)   |

4. Reload the website. The page will show these files when they exist; if a file is missing, it will show a fallback image instead.

**Tip:** For the hero, pick the largest/highest‑resolution image so it stays sharp on big screens.
